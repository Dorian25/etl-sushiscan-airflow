# etl-sushiscan-airflow

I created this program to `extract` data from the website [sushiscan.su](https://sushiscan.su/) (a manga online reading site in french), `load` them into a MongoDB database and then use their `Data API`.

`The MongoDB Atlas Data API lets you read and write data in Atlas with standard HTTPS requests. To use the Data API, all you need is an HTTPS client and a valid API key.`

The final goal is to provide daily updated data to one of my projects [Get-mangas](https://github.com/Dorian25/get-mangas).
